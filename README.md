# womanflower
This code draws a woman wearing a hat with a flower. It uses the turtle module in python. 

The turtle module in Python is a graphics library used to create pictures and drawings using a turtle metaphor. It provides an object-oriented interface to create shapes, lines, curves, and other graphics objects on a turtle screen. The turtle graphics system was inspired by the Logo programming language, which was designed to teach children the basics of programming.

In turtle graphics, a turtle is a cursor that can be moved around the screen, and the movements of the turtle can be controlled using various methods and commands. The turtle can be directed to move forward or backward, turn left or right, draw lines or circles, and more. The turtle also has attributes such as its size, color, and shape, which can be modified to create different effects.

The turtle module is widely used in teaching programming to beginners because of its simplicity and intuitive nature. It is also used in various fields such as mathematics, physics, and computer graphics for creating visualizations and simulations.
